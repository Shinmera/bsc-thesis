\begin{abstract}
  Over recent years the amount of recorded and observed data has increased massively. Many systems are now dealing with enormous volumes of data and continuous streams of new data arriving in real-time. This change in trends has prompted a need for systems that are capable of dealing with such hard real-time, large volume constraints. \\

  A multitude of such systems have been developed, each with their own focus areas, strengths, and weaknesses. One such system under development at ETH is Strymon, based on Timely Dataflow. \\
  
  In this thesis we survey a number of papers on streaming data processing systems and assess their evaluation experiments. We also implement three major benchmarks for Strymon that have found widespread use in the industry: the Yahoo Streaming Benchmark, Intel's HiBench, and the NEXMark benchmark. We briefly evaluate the results of the implementations of these benchmarks for the Timely system. Finally, we discuss important points that need to be addressed for the formulation of a future benchmark for streaming systems.
