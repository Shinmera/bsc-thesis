\subsection{S4: Distributed Stream Computing Platform\cite{s4}}
\imagefigure{images/s4-graphs.pdf}{Graphs of the three tests used to evaluate the S4 platform. From left to right: word count, click-through rate, and online parameter optimisation. Orange nodes are stateful. Nodes coloured in red retain state of previous stream events.}

\subsection{SPADE: the system s declarative stream processing engine\cite{spade}}
\imagefigure{images/spade-graphs.pdf}{Graph of the example used in the SPADE paper: a bargain index computation. Nodes coloured in red retain state of previous stream events.}

\subsection{Discretized streams: an efficient and fault-tolerant model for stream processing on large clusters\cite{discretized}}
\imagefigure{images/discretized-graphs.pdf}{Graph of the Word Count example used to illustrate the discretized streams. Not shown is the incremental reduction done between batches.}

\subsection{MillWheel: fault-tolerant stream processing at internet scale\cite{millwheel}}

\subsection{BigDataBench: A big data benchmark suite from internet services\cite{bigdatabench}}

\subsection{StreamCloud: An elastic and scalable data streaming system\cite{streamcloud}}
\imagefigure{images/streamcloud-graphs.pdf}{Graph of the query used to evaluate StreamCloud. Nodes coloured in red retain state of previous stream events.}

\subsection{Integrating scale out and fault tolerance in stream processing using operator state management\cite{integrating}}
\imagefigure{images/integrating-graphs.pdf}{Illustration of the queries for the Linear Road Benchmark (top) and the Top-K (bottom) tests used to evaluate their system. Orange nodes maintain internal state.}
