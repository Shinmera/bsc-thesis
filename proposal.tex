\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive survey of existing benchmarks for streaming engines and implement two such popular benchmarks on Strymon~\cite{strymon}, 
a novel system for online analytics developed by the Systems Group at ETH Z\"urich.

% This text was partly inspired by: https://blog.twitter.com/2013/observability-at-twitter
%
% This paragraph should expand on the project setting.  It currently describes
% instrumentation points but it might be more illustrative to give examples of
% questions we are trying to answer.
The project fits into a broader effort to understand and
compare the performance of streaming engines like Beam, Flink, Heron, Spark Streaming, and Apex.  
Although these system have gained much popularity over the last years, there is a surprising lack of standard benchmarks in the area:
some works rely on rather old and complicated workloads, which are difficult to implement and understand, whereas others introduce custom dataflows, which are often too simple (e.g., word count)
and do not reflect the requirements of real-world use cases. 

The Yahoo Streaming Benchmark (YSB)~\cite{ysb} and NexMark~\cite{nexmark} were introduced to fill exactly this gap, and both of them have already been implemented on the most promising streaming engines such as
Flink, Heron, and Spark Streaming. The main goal of this thesis is to implement these two benchmarks on Strymon and conduct a thorough experimental evaluation.

Apart from the evaluation, the thesis will also provide a comparative study of existing benchmarks and current experimental practices.
This includes a classification of benchmarks based on various criteria such as the types of operators used (sliding vs tumbling vs variable-length windows, stateful vs stateless operators),
the support for testing fault-tolerance, scaling and other core system mechanisms, the requirements for integration with external systems (e.g., Kafka), 
and the complexity of custom operators (e.g., pattern matching), among others.

Optionally, the thesis could result in the specification of a new streaming benchmark that unifies and extends the existing ones.\\

\section{Work plan}

The work consists of the following stages, some of which can be performed in
parallel:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] Survey of literature on streaming benchmarks and current experimental practices. 
 
  \item[2.] Familiarization with Strymon's architecture and programming model.

  \item[3.] Implementation of some commonly used operators (e.g., tumbling window) as built-in Strymon operators.

  \item[4a.] Implementation of YSB and NexMark on Strymon using the operators of the previous step.
  \item[4b.] Experimental evaluation of Strymon and analysis of performance results.

  \item[5a.] (Optional) Implementation of an Apache Beam runner for Strymon.
  \item[5b.] (Optional) Specification of a good benchmark for streaming engines.
  
\end{itemize}

There is the opportunity to select new computations and repeat step 4 either
because early attempts failed, or if new avenues open up.  Additionally, it is
to be expected that, in a system with weird and interesting performance
properties, new trade-offs, opportunities, and restrictions may emerge.
Identifying and articulating their details is also valuable.

It should be stressed that the primary goal of the project is not "to produce a
new benchmark", but to highlight the pros and cons of existing benchmarks and implement two popular benchmarks
on Strymon.

\section{Deliverables}

The project should result in the following concrete deliverables:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Thesis dissertation. This should follow the normal format for
    such a report, and contain at least the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Introduction / motivation of the problem
    \item Survey of streaming benchmarks
    \item Detailed description of the design and implementation of YSB and NexMark on Strymon
    \item Description of Strymon's experimental evaluation
    \item Discussion of unresolved issues, lessons learned, and future work
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Complete source code for:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Operator libraries and benchmarks, including any micro-benchmarks used
      \item Patches introducing necessary functionality in Strymon
      \item All tooling used to analyze the benchmark results
      \item Scripts used to conduct experiments
    \end{enumerate}

  \item Presentation of thesis results and demonstration of functionality
\end{enumerate}

\section{Notenschema}

The minimum requirements for a grade of 5.0 are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Successful completion of work items 1 -- 4.
  \item Completion of deliverables 1 -- 3 to a satisfactory standard.
\end{itemize}

The grade will be reduced if these goals are not achieved, except in the case
of extreme extenuating circumstances (such as an unforeseeable and unresolvable
technical barrier to completing the work, accompanied by an acceptable
alternative work item).

A grade of 5.50 will be awarded for the completion of the minimum work to an
unusually high quality, or with the addition of extra research work accompanied
by documentation and writeup in the thesis.
